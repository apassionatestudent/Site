// => public/utils/buildFieldDiff.js
// => Own copy, no shared file between admin and student backends per the
//    no-shared-code policy. Compares an existing DB record against
//    submitted fields and builds a human-readable "field: old -> new"
//    diff for activity log action_detail. Only fields that actually
//    changed are included - unchanged fields (the majority of any
//    partial-update payload) are silently skipped rather than padding
//    the log with noise.
// => Values are normalized before comparing: null/undefined/empty string
//    are all treated as the same "blank" value, so switching between
//    them doesn't falsely register as a change.
// => labels lets callers show a friendlier name than the raw column name
//    (e.g. { contact_no: 'Contact No.' }) - falls back to the raw key
//    when no label is given.
